# Railway Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Status: Deployment Failed

## Immediate Actions:

### 1. Check Railway Logs
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on the failed deployment
3. Check the "Build Logs" and "Deploy Logs"
4. Look for specific error messages

### 2. Common Error Messages & Solutions:

#### **"Module not found" errors:**
- Solution: Check `requirements.txt` for typos
- Solution: Ensure all dependencies are listed

#### **"Port already in use" errors:**
- Solution: Railway handles ports automatically
- Solution: Check if `host='0.0.0.0'` is set

#### **"Build timeout" errors:**
- Solution: PyTorch is too heavy for initial build
- Solution: Start with minimal dependencies

#### **"Memory exceeded" errors:**
- Solution: Reduce model size
- Solution: Use lighter ML libraries

## Current Test Setup:

We've created a **minimal test version** to isolate the problem:

- **`api/simple_app.py`** - Basic Flask app without ML
- **`api/requirements_minimal.txt`** - Only Flask + CORS
- **Updated `Procfile`** - Points to simple app

## Step-by-Step Recovery:

### Phase 1: Test Basic Deployment
1. **Deploy with simple app** (current setup)
2. **Verify basic Flask works**
3. **Check if Railway can handle Python**

### Phase 2: Add Dependencies Gradually
1. **Add Pillow** for image processing
2. **Test image upload functionality**
3. **Add PyTorch last**

### Phase 3: Full ML Model
1. **Load the actual model**
2. **Test prediction endpoint**
3. **Optimize for production**

## Alternative Solutions:

### Option 1: Use Railway's Python Template
1. Start with Railway's Python template
2. Gradually add your code
3. More reliable than custom setup

### Option 2: Split Frontend/Backend
1. Deploy frontend on Vercel/Netlify
2. Deploy backend on Railway
3. Connect via CORS

### Option 3: Use Different Platform
1. **Render** - Good Python support
2. **Heroku** - Classic choice
3. **DigitalOcean App Platform** - Reliable

## Next Steps:

1. **Try deploying again** with the simple app
2. **Check Railway logs** for specific errors
3. **Share error messages** if deployment still fails
4. **Consider alternatives** if Railway continues to fail
